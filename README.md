This repository tracks my personal progress through Aurelien Geron's text *Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow*. The examples, plots, pipelines, etc are all inspired by this book, and my uploading of this code is solely for my own education. I have really enjoyed learning from this book, and highly recommend it.
